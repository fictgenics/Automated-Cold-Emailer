# Cold Email Generator

![App Secreenshot](https://github.com/fictgenics/Automated-Cold-Emailer/blob/main/App_screenshot.png)

Every once in a while, a new tool comes along that simplifies something so complex, it changes the way you work.

This is one of those tools.

It’s not just an email generator. It’s a vision for how you connect with the world. It takes the noise—the busywork, the endless forms, the generic templates—and strips it away, leaving you with what's essential: a powerful, personalized message.

This app is a bicycle for your mind. A tool that gives you leverage.

## The Technology

We started with a simple idea: take the complexity of modern job hunting and make it profoundly simple. We built this on **Streamlit**, a platform that lets us focus on the user experience, not the infrastructure. Our core is an **LLM** that understands language, extracts what matters, and crafts a response that feels human.

It just works.

## Getting Started

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. We've made the setup as simple as the product itself.

### Requirements

* A Mac, Windows, or Linux machine with Python 3.9 or later.

### Installation

Just one command:

```
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourGitHubUsername]/[YourRepoName].git
cd [YourRepoName]
```

Then, install the dependencies with one more command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Powering the Experience

This tool is powered by a Google API key. It's the engine, and it needs to be yours. Add your key to a file called `.env` in the project's root directory.

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY="[Your Google API Key]"
```

We take your privacy seriously. This file is not checked into our system.

### Launch

To run the app, simply type this into your terminal:

```
streamlit run App/main.py
```

The app will open, and you'll see a clean interface. There's nothing to learn. It’s exactly how you'd expect it to be.

## We're Just Getting Started

We believe in progress. And we’re putting a ding in the universe with this project.
